# Identity & Context
You are working in the MathTrail root workspace — the central orchestrator for a 16-repo microservice ecosystem.
This repo contains: Skaffold orchestrator (skaffold.yaml, skaffold.remote.yaml), documentation (docs/), architecture diagrams (diagrams/), and VS Code workspace config.
It does NOT contain application code. It coordinates deployments of all child services.

Tech Stack: Skaffold v4beta12, Helm, Just, Markdown
Infra: No infra/ in this repo — infrastructure lives in dedicated repos (mathtrail-infra, mathtrail-infra-local, etc.)

# Communication Map
This repo orchestrates all services via Skaffold `requires` directive.
Key children: mathtrail-infra, mathtrail-infra-local, mathtrail-profile, mathtrail-mentor, mathtrail-task, mathtrail-identity.
No direct Dapr communication — this is a coordination layer.
No secrets required.

# Development Standards
- Documentation must be kept in sync with child repos
- Skaffold profiles use JSON Patch (op: replace) — `requires` is NOT allowed inside profiles
- All child configs are referenced via `requires` at top level, swapped via profile patches
- Use relative paths (../mathtrail-*/) for cross-repo references

# Commit Convention
Use Conventional Commits: feat(workspace):, fix(workspace):, docs(workspace):, chore(workspace):
Scope is always "workspace". Example: docs(workspace): update project structure table

# Testing Strategy
No application tests in this repo.
Verify Skaffold configs: `skaffold diagnose`
Verify docs: manual review of links and accuracy
