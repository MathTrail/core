# MathTrail Claude Instructions

## Project Overview
MathTrail is an AI-driven platform that helps students learn to solve math olympiad problems.  
The main repositories:
- `mathtrail-mentor` — AI microservice with task generation and user management.
- `mathtrail-ui-web` — web UI for students.
- `mathtrail-ui-chatgpt` — ChatGPT interface for students.
- `mathtrail-infrastructure` — environment setup and deployment scripts.
- `mathtrail-infrastructure-observability` — monitoring and telemetry configuration.

## Claude Agent Goals
1. Generate, edit, and review code for the MathTrail platform.
2. Assist with documentation, diagrams, and architecture explanations.
3. Ensure code changes align with project conventions and multi-repository dependencies.

## Notes
- Focus on educational aspects of MathTrail (task flow, user progress, hints).
- When suggesting edits, consider both Mentor service and UI integration.
